  example).

# ANALYSIS

+ install the code in your computer by `pip instll -e .` under this directory;
+ Selection of galaxies since we need to select galaxies with high-SNR and
  resolution for accurate shape and magnitude estimation (see [this
  notebook](./example_catalog/1_analysis.ipynb));
+ Derive inclination angle from the galaxy shapes (see [this notebook](
  ./example_catalog/1_analysis.ipynb)).
